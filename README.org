* About

Primarily a repository for my GNU Emacs configuration, along with related software.

My configuration is primarily built for my primary laptop, which is a MacBook Air M1. I also have a work laptop, a MacBook Air M2, as well as various smaller Linux machines for various tasks.

For my MacOS-related computers, I mainly use ~brew~ to manage their software, but I also rely on language-specific tools like ~GHCup~ and ~rustup~.
