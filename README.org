#+TITLE: Sebastian's dotfiles

* About

Primarily a repository for my GNU Emacs configuration, along with related software.

My configuration is primarily built around my primary workstation, which is a PC using Arch Linux.
I also have a laptop, MacBook Air M1, and a work laptop, MacBook Air M2, which also uses some of these configuration files.

For my Arch Linux computer, I use ~pacman~ to manage its software, along with language-specific tools like ~GHCup~ and ~rustup~.
For my MacOS-related computers, I mainly use ~brew~ to manage their software, along with language-specific tools.
